# Project-Gaia
Project Gaia. A task tracker and management application, purpose-built for keeping track of planting operations for growers and greenhouse operations.

This project is being developed by me on my own, and I am learning React, JavaScript and how to impement the Chakra-UI framework for this project. I am developing this for my dad's small business, with the hope of streamlining a process that normally takes 5-6 months down to just 1-2 weeks.
